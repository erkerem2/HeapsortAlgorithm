# HeapsortAlgorithm

# HeapSort Project foor Analysis of Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project implements several fundamental algorithms crucial for understanding heap operations and their applications in sorting and priority queues. Specifically, it includes implementations of the MAX-HEAPIFY, BUILD-MAX-HEAP, HEAPSORT procedures, priority queue operations, and extensions to d-ary heaps without the use of external libraries. The project aims to demonstrate the efficiency and applications of these algorithms in computer science.

## Compilation and Execution

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Command line/terminal access

### Compilation

To compile the HeapSort project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
g++ Heapsort.cpp -o Heapsort
```

### Execution
The program accepts command-line arguments for different heap operations. Examples of execution commands are:
```
./Heapsort population2.csv heapsort out.csv
./Heapsort population3.csv heap_increase_key out.csv i435 k2749
./Heapsort population1.csv dary_calculate_height out.csv d5
```
